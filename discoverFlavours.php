                <p>Preparation of flavours involves a rigorous process. Some flavours are prepared from essential oils (flavours of Vanilla pods, nuts and citruses) some are prepared from synthetic chemicals. The sweet fruity flavours are derived by the process of expression and the spicy flavours are derived through extraction.</p><br>
                <p>Some flavouring is prepared by concocting essential oils with synthetic organic chemicals, or entirely from synthetic chemicals with a mix of alcohol, glycerol, Propylene glycol, alone or in combination as solvents.</p>
