                    <p>It takes over 700 different ingredients and several years to develop a special formula for perfume. The perfume oil collected is blended with alcohol based on the amount determined by experts. Most perfumes are made of 10-20% perfume oils dissolved in alcohol. Colognes are made from 3-5% oils diluted in 80-90% alcohol and 10% water.</p>
